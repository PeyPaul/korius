Yeah he doesn't stop anymore... Are you still here? Okay that's fine... Because I wanted to restart our conversation and he stayed at the previous conversation I have the impression. Is that possible or not? I think it's in the Eleven Labs model from the beginning So he has to stop because basically when you do the demo you can't cut it. Like even when you use it on the app... You can't cut it? You can't cut it. But how does he stop? I don't know if we can manipulate this or not. Because there, for example, I'm doing a curl so I created a... I know, so you have to wait until he finishes his sentence, right? Well if I restart I think he will be on the same conversation as before. Impossible. No you're right. Hello!"

I created an endpoint API for your agent, and basically now I'm asking him to start the conversation. This is the first time that I've launched it and it worked so now he said hello and stuff. Then i say hi my name is Hugo. And then when i restart the same call, It captured the fact that you are Hugo? Yes exactly, which means that he still has the same... But this is probably my code right? Maybe it's me who ... Yeah because at home... But I have to ask him to stop the conversation. There's a problem. No but you take care of yourself. It's only on my side, I have to understand what's going on in the code. No dealership no dealership. But hey it was a good start! Can you put water?"
